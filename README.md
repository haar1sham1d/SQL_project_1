# SQL_project_1

## Description

A simple example of some queries I have learned via DataCamp. The csv and image were provided by DataCamp along with a task for me to complete. This was a great starter project to showcase my skills, having complete the intro to SQL and intermediate SQL courses.

## My task:

Explore and analyze the students data to see how the length of stay (stay) impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study.
